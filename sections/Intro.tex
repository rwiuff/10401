In recent years a large and quickly growing collaboration between plasma physicists and engineers have materialised into one of the most ambitious energy producing projects ever seen. The proof-of-concept plasma fusion tokamak reactor ITER\footnote{\url{https://www.iter.org/}} in Cadarache is currently taking shape in order to address the issue of growing energy demands and climate changes.\newline The mission is simple: Prove that plasma fusion is a viable source of electricity.\newline
Whilst not being the most surmountable task, many researchers and institutions have gathered from across the world, including the Department of Physics at DTU.\newline
In this paper, three assignments are solved as part of the course ``10401 Fusion Energy and Fusion Plasma Physics''. Some key aspects of fusion plasma fuelled reactors are addressed and discussed in the assignments.
